This is a simple program to modify the palettes of images. I designed it for Geopixels, but it will work for Wplace too.
This program does not offer any dithering. It just changes all colors in the image to the closest match in your palette or will create a simpler palette automatically.

To run
Python 3.14.0

Instructions

1. Select an image
2. Under options, Select a palette, Wplace free, Wplace complete, and Geopixels Free are set as default in the program.
2A. If you would like the palette of the image automatically simplified, select simplify palette and chose a similarity threshold.
3. Click run, The palette of the image will be modified. If simplify palette is selected, The palette will be modified to mark similar colors as the same colors as long as they are with the threshold.

I hope that the program is self explanatory.

Please Leave me any suggestions or tips
